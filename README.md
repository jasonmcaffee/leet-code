# LeetCode Solutions Visualization

This project provides interactive visualizations of various data structures and algorithms, starting with a Min Heap implementation. The visualizations are built using React and Three.js to create an engaging 3D experience.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of a Min Heap
- Real-time node addition and heap property maintenance
- Color-coded nodes to show heap operations
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leet-code.git
cd leet-code
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

- Click "Add Random Value" to insert a new node into the heap
- Use arrow keys to scroll up and down the visualization
- The visualization will automatically maintain the heap property
- New nodes are shown in green
- Nodes affected by heap operations are shown in blue
- Default nodes are shown in purple

## Technologies Used

- React
- Three.js
- TypeScript
- Next.js
